    paragraphs: [
      "Roof restoration is a comprehensive process that brings an ageing or worn roof back to a sound, watertight and visually improved condition without the cost and disruption of a full replacement. It is ideal for tile, metal and some concrete roofs across Sydney and surrounding areas.",
      "A typical roof restoration includes: a thorough clean to remove dirt, moss, lichen and debris; replacement of broken or cracked tiles and damaged flashings; re-bedding and re-pointing of ridge cappings and hip tiles where mortar has failed; sealing of cracks and joints; and the application of a protective roof coating or paint. For tile roofs, we also repoint and re-bed where needed to restore structural integrity and prevent water entry. The final coating helps reflect heat, resist moisture and UV, and improves the overall appearance of your home.",
      "Choosing restoration over replacement can save you a significant amount while extending the life of your existing roof by 15–20 years when done correctly. Our licensed team uses quality materials and follows best practice so your restored roof performs reliably for years to come.",

        text: "A professional restoration addresses wear, failed mortar and minor damage before they turn into major leaks or structural issues. With proper cleaning, repairs and coatings, your existing roof can deliver many more years of reliable service, delaying the need for an expensive full replacement.",

        text: "Re-bedding, re-pointing and sealing close the gaps that let water in. By fixing loose or missing ridge cappings, cracked tiles and deteriorated flashings, we stop moisture from reaching the ceiling and structure, helping to avoid mould, rot and costly internal repairs.",

        title: "Improve Appearance and Cost-Effective vs Replacement",
        text: "Restoration removes staining and gives the roof a clean, uniform finish with a new coating or paint. The result often looks like a new roof at a fraction of the cost of re-roofing. You get better curb appeal and protection without the larger spend and longer timeline of a full replacement.",
