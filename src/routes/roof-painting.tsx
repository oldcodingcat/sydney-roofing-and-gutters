      answer: "High-build membranes offer superior color retention and elasticity for bridging micro-cracks, ideal for aged tiles near the coast. Premium acrylic paint works excellently on substrates in good condition. We recommend based on roof inspection and sun/salt exposure." 
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the roof painting process take?",
      answer: "A typical home is completed in 2–4 days depending on condition, size, weather and curing time between coats. We prioritize safe weather windows to ensure adhesion and finish quality." 
    },
    {
      question: "Do reflective colours really reduce heat?",
      answer: "Yes. Reflective pigments can lower roof surface temperature and assist your home's thermal efficiency, especially during Hunter summers." 
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need council approval to change colour?",
      answer: "Typically not for standard colour changes, but heritage areas or planned unit developments may have local guidelines. We can advise on neighbourhood-compatible options." 
    },
    {
      question: "What warranty do you provide?",
