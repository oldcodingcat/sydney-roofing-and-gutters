    <p class="text-[#666666] leading-relaxed mb-6">Flat roof systems are roofing structures with minimal slope, typically less than 10 degrees, designed to provide weather protection while maximizing usable space. These systems offer several advantages including increased living space, modern architectural appeal, easier maintenance access, and potential for rooftop installations such as solar panels or green roofs. They're particularly suitable for commercial buildings and modern residential designs throughout Newcastle.</p>

    <p class="text-[#666666] leading-relaxed mb-6">The primary benefits of flat roof systems include space efficiency, cost-effectiveness, modern aesthetics, and versatility for various applications. They provide excellent opportunities for rooftop amenities, HVAC equipment placement, and future expansions. However, they require careful design and installation to ensure proper drainage and weather protection in Newcastle's challenging coastal environment.</p>

Proper maintenance can prevent costly repairs and extend the life of your flat roof system.</p>

    <p class="text-[#666666] leading-relaxed mb-6">Seasonal maintenance is particularly important for flat roof systems in Newcastle's climate.
