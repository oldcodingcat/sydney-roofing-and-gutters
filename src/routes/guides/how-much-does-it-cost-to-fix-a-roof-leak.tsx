      "A roof leak can quickly escalate from a damp patch to mould, rot, and damage to insulation, ceilings and structure. Addressing it early usually keeps costs down and limits harm to your home. In this guide we look at what influences the cost of fixing a roof leak in Australia, typical price ranges, and how to decide between a repair, a roof restoration or a full replacement.",
      "The final cost depends on the cause and location of the leak, the type of roof, ease of access, the extent of hidden damage, and whether other work is needed first. For that reason, ballpark figures are only a starting point. A proper quote requires an on-site inspection by a licensed roofer.",
      "We also outline a simple checklist of steps to take as soon as you notice a leak, and when it makes sense to repair a single defect versus restoring the whole roof or replacing it. Use this as a practical reference; for advice tailored to your property, always get a professional assessment.",

      "Contact a licensed roofing contractor for an inspection; avoid delaying as hidden damage and cost tend to increase over time.",
      "Get at least two written quotes that clearly list the scope: leak location, materials, and any preparatory work (e.g. mould, timber).",

      heading: "Why Roof Leaks Need Prompt Attention",
      paragraphs: [
        "Even a small or intermittent leak can allow water into the roof space, where it can soak insulation, rot timber battens or trusses, and create ideal conditions for mould. Once mould or structural damage appears, the scope of work and cost increase. Water can also run along beams or inside walls and affect electrical wiring, increasing safety risks.",
        "Addressing a leak quickly usually limits the spread of damage and keeps the repair smaller and more affordable. Delaying often means replacing larger areas of roofing, fixing internal linings, or treating mould - all of which add to the final bill.",

      heading: "What Affects the Cost of Fixing a Roof Leak?",
      paragraphs: [
        "Several factors influence the final price. Understanding them helps you interpret quotes and ask the right questions.",
        "Type and source of the leak: A simple fix - for example, a single dislodged tile or a small gap at a penetration - is usually cheaper than a leak from a failed valley, damaged flashing or widespread deterioration. Harder-to-find leaks can add diagnostic time and cost.",
        "Access and roof layout: Steep pitches, multiple levels, and confined or awkward access can require more time, safety gear and labour. Single-storey, easy-to-reach roofs tend to be less expensive to work on.",
        "Roofing material: Costs vary by material (e.g. concrete or clay tiles, metal, slate) and availability of matching pieces. Special orders or custom flashings can add to the bill.",
        "Internal and structural damage: If water has damaged sarking, battens, ceiling linings or structure, those repairs are typically quoted separately. Mould remediation may also be needed and will add cost.",
        "Urgency and timing: Emergency or after-hours work usually costs more than scheduling during normal business hours. If the leak can be temporarily contained, you may be able to avoid premium call-out fees.",
      ],
      bullets: [
        "Type and source of the leak (localised vs widespread, easy vs hard to find).",
        "Roof access, pitch and complexity (safety and labour time).",
        "Roofing material and need for matching or specialty parts.",
        "Internal damage: sarking, battens, ceiling, mould - often quoted separately.",

      heading: "Indicative Cost Ranges for Roof Leak Repairs",
      paragraphs: [
        "The figures below are broad guides only. Real costs depend on your roof, the cause of the leak, your location and the contractor. Always get a written quote after an on-site inspection.",
        "Simple, localised repairs (e.g. one or two tiles, a small flashing fix, or resealing around a pipe) might sit in the low hundreds of dollars. More involved work - such as valley or flashing replacement, or repairs across several square metres - can reach the mid to high hundreds or more. If the leak has caused significant internal damage, mould treatment or structural repairs, costs can run into the thousands. A full roof restoration or replacement is a separate project and priced accordingly.",
        "We strongly recommend getting at least two itemised quotes from licensed roofers. Repairs done poorly can fail quickly or worsen the problem, so prioritise experience and clarity in the quote over the lowest headline price.",
      ],
      bullets: [
        "Simple localised fixes: often in the low hundreds (e.g. a few hundred dollars); exact amount depends on labour and materials.",
        "Larger or trickier repairs (valleys, multi-tile, complex flashings): mid to high hundreds or more.",
        "Where internal damage, mould or structural work is needed: costs can extend well into the thousands; these are usually quoted separately.",

        "Take photos or short videos of the leak from inside and, if visible from the ground, any suspicious areas on the roof (e.g. missing tiles, damaged flashings) to share with the roofer.",
        "Contact a licensed roofing contractor to book an inspection; mention it is a leak so they can prioritise if needed.",

      heading: "Repair, Restoration or Replacement: When to Choose What",
      paragraphs: [
        "A targeted repair is suitable when the leak is localised and the rest of the roof is in good condition. For example, a few broken or slipped tiles, a failed section of flashing, or a cracked vent seal can often be fixed without touching the rest of the roof. This is usually the most cost-effective option when the problem is limited.",
        "Roof restoration is worth considering when the roof is generally sound but shows widespread wear: faded or perished coatings, widespread re-pointing or re-bedding needs, or multiple minor defects. A restoration typically includes a full clean, repairs, re-bedding and re-pointing where needed, and a protective coating. It can extend the life of the roof and address several potential leak sources at once. If you have had a leak and the rest of the roof is ageing, your contractor may suggest a restoration to reduce the chance of future leaks.",
        "Replacement is the right choice when the structure or roofing is too deteriorated to repair or restore safely and economically - for example, major batten or truss damage, or roofing that is at end of life. A full re-roof is a larger investment but may be the only viable long-term option. A licensed roofer can advise which option fits your situation after an inspection.",

      heading: "How to Get an Accurate Quote",
      paragraphs: [
        "An accurate price requires an on-site inspection. A roofer needs to see the leak’s cause, the condition of the surrounding roof, and any damage inside the roof space. Descriptions or photos can help with an initial triage, but they cannot replace a physical inspection.",
        "Ask for a written quote that lists: the identified cause of the leak, the exact work to be done (e.g. tiles to replace, flashings, sealing), the materials to be used, and whether the price includes or excludes internal repairs, mould treatment or scaffolding. If the roofer finds additional issues during the job, they should explain them and get your approval before doing extra work. A clear, itemised quote helps you compare offers and avoid unexpected charges.",

      paragraphs: [
        "It depends on your policy and the cause of the leak. Many home and building policies cover damage from specific events - such as storms, falling trees, or impact - which can include resulting roof leaks. They often do not cover leaks caused by wear and tear, lack of maintenance, or gradual deterioration. Terms vary between insurers, so check your product disclosure statement and speak to your provider. If you intend to claim, take photos of the damage and keep receipts and reports; your insurer may request an assessor or a report from a licensed roofer.",
